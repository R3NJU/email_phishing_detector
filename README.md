# Email Phishing Detector
## Overview
Welcome to the Email Phishing URL Detector project! This tool is designed to identify phishing URLs within emails and flag them for further investigation. Phishing URLs often lead to malicious websites attempting to steal sensitive information, and it's crucial to have a reliable mechanism for detecting them. In the contemporary digital landscape, phishing attacks constitute a significant threat to cybersecurity, often serving as a gateway for more severe security breaches. 
<br>This project aims to develop an automated solution to identify and classify phishing emails and malicious URLs. Utilizing machine learning models and leveraging an open-source email server on CentOS.

## Features

* **Machine Learning-Based Detection:** The detector employs machine learning models trained on known phishing URL patterns to enhance its accuracy in identifying potential threats.
* **URL Scanning:** The tool scans emails for URLs and utilizes the trained machine learning models to determine if a URL is likely to be a phishing link.
* **User-Friendly Output:** When a phishing URL is detected, the system provides clear and detailed information about the threat, allowing users to take appropriate action.
